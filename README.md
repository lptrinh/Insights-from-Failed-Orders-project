Title: Insights from Failed Orders

Programming language: Python

Background: Gett, previously known as GetTaxi, is an Israeli-developed technology platform solely focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM). They have an application where clients can order taxis, and drivers can accept their rides (offers). At the moment, when the client clicks the Order button in the application, the matching system searches for the most relevant drivers and offers them the order.

Objective: To investigate some matching metrics for orders that did not completed successfully, i.e., the customer didn't end up getting a car

Algorithm: Data wrangling with pandas and numpy, EDA, h3, folium.
