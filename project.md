## 1. Introduction
Gett, previously known as GetTaxi, is an Israeli-developed technology platform solely focused on 
corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM). They have an application where clients can order
taxis, and drivers can accept their rides (offers). At the moment, when the client clicks the Order
button in the application, the matching system searches for the most relevant drivers and offers
them the order.In this project, we would like to investigate some matching metrics for orders that
did not completed successfully, i.e., the customer didn't end up getting a car.
